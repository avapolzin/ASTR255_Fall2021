# ASTR255_Fall2021
Beginning Python tutorials for ASTR 255/PHYS 295 at Yale University, Fall 2021.


There are a number of ways to download only the relevant files from a GitHub repository. Feel free to use your favorite. In case you don't have one, I suggest using _wget_ on the command line. An example would be _'wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avapolzin/ASTR255_Fall2021/main/README.md'_, which will save this file as README.md to your local working directory. You can access the link to the raw version of any file by opening that file in GitHub, clicking raw, and then copying the url.

The tutorial topics are (roughly) as follows:
* Tutorial 1 -- basic plotting, data types, simple fitting
* Tutorial 2 -- histograms, more complex fitting
* Tutorial 3 -- basic astropy, FITS handling
